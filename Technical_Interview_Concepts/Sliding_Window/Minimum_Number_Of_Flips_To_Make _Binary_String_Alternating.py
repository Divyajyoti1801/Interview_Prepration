"""
MINIMUM NUMBER OF FLIPS TO MAKE BINARY STRING ALTERNATING

You are given a binary string s. You are allowed to perform two types of operations on the string in any sequence:

Type-1: Remove the character at the start of the string s and append it to the end of the string.
Type-2: Pick any character in s and flip its value, i.e., if its value is '0' it becomes '1' and vice-versa.
Return the minimum number of type-2 operations you need to perform such that s becomes alternating.

The string is called alternating if no two adjacent characters are equal.

For example, the strings "010" and "1010" are alternating, while the string "0100" is not.

Input: s = "111000"
Output: 2
Explanation: Use the first operation two times to make s = "100011".
Then, use the second operation on the third and sixth elements to make s = "101010".
